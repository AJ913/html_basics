<!-- 1. loop-is used for continous running of video without pausing.
    2. controls- this is used to control the video such as pause, mute,speed of the video etc.
3. auto play - playing another video after the current video is finished
 there will be a chrome issue for not autoplaying so we use attribute called mute. i.e when the video is in mute condition then only video will autoplay orelse the video will not play.-->
